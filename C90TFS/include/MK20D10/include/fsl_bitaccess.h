**     Revisions:
**     - rev. 1.0 (2012-01-03)
**         Initial version
**     - rev. 1.1 (2012-07-09)
**         UART0 - Fixed register definition - CEA709.1-B (LON) registers added.
**     - rev. 1.2 (2012-10-29)
**         Registers updated according to the new reference manual revision - Rev. 2, Jun 2012
**     - rev. 1.3 (2013-06-24)
**         NV_FOPT register - NMI_DIS bit added.
**         SPI - PCSIS bit group in MCR register updated.
**     - rev. 1.4 (2014-07-23)
**         Delay of 1 ms added to SystemInit() to ensure stable FLL output in FEI and FEE MCG modes.
**         Predefined SystemInit() implementation updated:
**         - External clock sources available on TWR board used.
**         - Added 1 ms waiting loop after entering FLL engaged MCG mode.
**     - rev. 1.5 (2014-08-28)
**         Update of startup files - possibility to override DefaultISR added.
**     - rev. 1.6 (2014-10-14)
**         Renamed interrupt vector Watchdog to WDOG_EWM and LPTimer to LPTMR0
